Git useful commands, and differences when using VSC (as the terminal here is Powershell).

Powershell commands:

- ni /filename/ - Adds a file to the current directory.

- cat /filename/ - Show the contents of a file in the terminal.

- cd /directoryname/ - Changes the terminal working position to any specified directory.

- cd .. - Moves the terminal working position back by one.

- clear - Clears the terminal.

- cli - Delete the content within an item, ergo a file, without deleting the file itself.

- del - Delete a file or a directory.

- diff - Compares two items, ergo files.

- gps - If you want to see all the processes on your pc at any given time, for whatever reason.

- mi - Moves an item from one place to another.


Git specific commands:

- git clone /url/ - This command is used to clone a repository onto VSC, or whatever text editor you are using, through the repositories 
  online link.

- git init - From my experience this can be used to turn any random folder on your pc into a repository.

- git add /filename/ - This will add whichever file you want to the index before you can commit it. In VSC, any file is automatically 
  indexed when you save the file, I think.

- git mv /filename/ ... /destination/ - I think that's the syntax, though it might be wrong, as this is practically a useless command for VSC
  users. Anyways, this is used to move or rename files and directories.

- git restore - If you can believe it, this is used to restore files and directories.

- git rm /filename/ - rm means remove, this command removes a file from the working tree. This can also be done simply from the VSC UI.

- git rm /filename/ -f - The same as rm, but -f forces the deletion of the file even if it is in the index.

- git branch - It make a branch!! Like literally every other git command, this can easily be done through VSC UI.

- git commit - In theory this should allow you to commit your changes in the working tree and index.

- git merge - This will merge 2 seperate iterations of the same file into one. Can be used to resolve conflicts when multiple people
  commit at once, or to merge to deliberately made branches.
